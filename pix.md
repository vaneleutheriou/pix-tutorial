# Register the Pix key

## What is a Pix key?

The Pix key is a simplification of your bank account data. In traditional transfers and payments made via DOC and TED, it's necessary to share data such as banking institution, name, agency, account number and CPF/CNPJ. Pix lets you or your company receive payments from a single piece of information: the Pix key. 

The Pix key might be a mobile phone number or CPF/CNPJ or an email.

To start receiving transfers using one piece of data, register your Pix key in the bank's app. Transfers received using this key will be made available in your bank account.
